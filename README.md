# Software-Security
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?



What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

It is vital to identify security vulnerabillities in order to protect the software from attacks that target data. Software security allows companies to safeguard it's user data and lower some of the security risks.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

While assessing the vunerabillities I had to learn how to supress false-positives so that I could focus on the actual vunerabillity.


How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I refactored the code to incorporate Https which is more secure than Http. In the future I would probably do whichever process is most secure at the moment.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ran the application and also preformed a static test to see if there were new vunerabillities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?


Using the maven tools to detect the vunerabillities was very helpful and will continue to be useful in the future.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I would want future employers to know about my experience with supressing false-positives, identifying vunerabillities and about creating a secure Https application.
